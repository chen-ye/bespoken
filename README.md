========

Bespoken is a web-based slide presentation app, where you write your slides while giving your presentation.

Bespoken runs on Google Chrome, and uses the Google Web Speech API to transcribe the speaker's words. Keyboard controls, which can be directed using a Leap Motion or other device as well, allow users to start/stop dictation and add slides to their presentations.
